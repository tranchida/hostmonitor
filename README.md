# HostMonitor

This project demonstrates a basic Golang web application that uses:
- **labstack/echo** as the web framework.
- **htmx** as lightweight library that enhances HTML with AJAX, CSS transitions, and server-sent events, enabling dynamic, interactive web applications without heavy JavaScript.
- **a-h/templ** for HTML templating.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling.
- **gopsutil** for system information.
- **go-humanize** for human-readable units.
