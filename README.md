# HostMonitor

This project demonstrates a basic Golang web application that uses:
- **gin-gonic** as the web framework.
- **htmx** as lightweight library that enhances HTML with AJAX, CSS transitions, and server-sent events, enabling dynamic, interactive web applications without heavy JavaScript.
- **http/template** for HTML templating.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling.

## install tailwindcss

```npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli```

### run tailwindcss cli watch

```npx @tailwindcss/cli -i style.css -o ./static/style.css --watch```
